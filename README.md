# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains four practical projects in **Data Analysis**
using **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.\
The projects focus on sales data, customer insights, and business
performance visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Sales Data Analysis (Excel)

**File:** `Sales Data Analysis.xlsx`

-   Cleaned and transformed raw sales data.\
-   Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pivot tables and
    formulas.\
-   Identified sales trends by region, product, and customer segments.\
-   Created summary reports to support decision-making.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ 2. SQL Project in Data Analysis

**File:** `SQL Project in Data Analysis.sql`

Key business questions answered with SQL queries:\
- Top 10 products by total sales.\
- Yearly sales performance.\
- Customers who spent more than **100,000** since 2020.\
- Employees with salaries above average and their sales contribution.\
- Most sold product category per country.

This project demonstrates skills in:\
âœ… Joins (INNER JOINs across multiple tables)\
âœ… Aggregations (SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING)\
âœ… Ranking and filtering business insights

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Power BI Dashboard

**File:** `Power BI Data Analysis & Dashboard.pbix`

-   Built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales and customer
    data.\
-   KPI tracking: total sales, top products, and customer segments.\
-   Time-based analysis (Year, Quarter, Month).\
-   Drill-through features for deeper insights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Python for Data Analysis

**File:** (Jupyter/Script files can be added here)

-   Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** using **Pandas &
    NumPy**.\
-   Built **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflows.\
-   Created **visualizations** using Matplotlib & Seaborn for trends and
    insights.\
-   Automated repetitive tasks to make analysis faster and more
    efficient.\
-   Example applications:
    -   Sales trends analysis\
    -   Customer segmentation\
    -   Correlation between sales & employee performance

This project demonstrates skills in:\
âœ… Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation\
âœ… Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization\
âœ… Writing clean, reusable Python scripts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸš€ Tools & Skills Used

-   **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning, Reports\
-   **SQL**: Joins, Aggregations, Business Queries\
-   **Power BI**: Data Modeling, DAX, Interactive Dashboards\
-   **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

------------------------------------------------------------------------
